# TobySnake
Personal Project

## What is it?
Remodeled the classic game of Snake on C++.

## How does it work?
There is ease of playing functionality with real-time keyboard input registering. The game is displayed in the terminal and is updated in real time
using the windows library.

## What's inside?
The source files are located in the root along with the preprocessed/compiled files object files in the obj folder. The executable application 
is runnable on windows systems and is located in the bin/Debug path.

## Changes?
* The game has encountered some minor display bugs when adding new features. Will recover functionality ASAP.
* Will add History functionality to save scores. (will support "High-scores" like in arcades)
